# CloudResumeProject
Cloud Portfolio Challenge
The Cloud Resume Challenge is a hands-on project where I built and deployed a personal resume website using AWS services like S3, Lambda, and DynamoDB. It involves creating a serverless architecture, setting up CI/CD pipelines, and securing the site with best practices in cloud infrastructure. This challenge showcases my proficiency in AWS, serverless computing, and DevOps automation.
